## **Why Use Next Store API?**

Many developers face challenges finding a reliable, ready-to-use API when working on front-end projects. The **Next Store API** solves this by offering:

- A **comprehensive dataset** of sample products, complete with names, prices, descriptions, images, and categories.
- Full control over managing and retrieving:
  - **Products**: Fetch, filter, and sort data easily.
  - **Users and Addresses**: Simulate user accounts and associated data.
  - **Carts and Purchases**: Enable shopping cart functionality and purchase tracking.
- A lightweight, local **relational database** powered by the **better-sqlite3** package, making it easy to run and query data on your machine.

## **Key Features**

- **E-Commerce Focus**: Ideal for testing and building front-end stores.
- **RESTful Design**: Designed with simplicity and scalability in mind, supporting CRUD operations across multiple endpoints.
- **Local Database**: Includes a relational database setup for quick development without requiring external servers.
- **Custom Data Handling**: Some routes require JSON objects for insertion, simulating real-world back-end interactions.
- **Developer-Friendly Tools**:
  - **API Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation to guide integration.
  - **Postman Collection**: Pre-configured collection for testing endpoints.
  - **Interactive Website**: A demo interface built to interact with the API.

## **Built With**

- **Node.js** and **Express.js**: For building a robust and scalable RESTful API.
- **Jsonwebtoken (JWT)**: To implement secure user authentication and authorisation.
- **Nodemailer**: For handling email notifications, such as order confirmations or user account updates.
- **Body-parser**: To parse incoming request bodies and ensure smooth data handling.
- **Bcryptjs**: For securely hashing and storing user passwords.
- **better-sqlite3**: A fast and simple relational database solution for local development.
- **Bootstrap**: To create a responsive, user-friendly front-end interface for the API demo.

## **Who Is This For?**

This API is designed for:

- **Front-End Developers**: Practice API integration and state management with a realistic e-commerce dataset.
- **Coding Students**: Build fully functional e-commerce applications for learning or portfolios.
- **Prototyping Projects**: Quickly create and test front-end designs without worrying about back-end complexity.

## **Why Next Store API Stands Out**

Unlike generic APIs, the Next Store API is specifically tailored for e-commerce projects. It provides structured, realistic data and intuitive endpoints, helping developers focus on front-end functionality while experiencing back-end integration in a hands-on way.

## Local Development

To run the project from a container, ensure that Node.js (version 14 or higher) and npm (version 7 or higher) are installed on your development machine.

### Instructions

- Fork this repository
- Clone your forked repository
- CD into the project folder
- Create a Gmail account if you donâ€™t have one. Additionally, enable two-step verification on your Google Account to generate an App Password. You will find usefull informations about how to do it on <a href="https://medium.com/@ayushnandanwar003/a-step-by-step-guide-to-sending-emails-with-node-js-and-nodemailer-via-gmail-c6fe1810f9fe">this resource</a>.
- Create a `.env` file in the root directory with those variables:

```shell
NODE_ENV = development
PORT =8080
EMAIL = YOUR EMAIL
PASSWORD = YOUR PASSWORD
```

To install the application:

```shell
npm install
```
